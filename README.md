# GTA-Suspend
A simple winform app to suspend + resume an app - Used for GTA "Solo Public" Lobbies

## Usage

Download the [release](https://github.com/Jack-Bailey/GTA-Suspend/releases) files into a folder and run GTA Suspend.exe

Input your duration in seconds - This may need fine tuning, too low and it won't work, too high and it'll crash your game. I find 10 works the best for me but feel free to play around with it.

Set your program. Use gta5 if you're using this for it's intended use.

Set close after run - personal preference - It's self explanatory.

> :warning: I take no responsibility for your usage of this program. If Rockstar bans your account you're at fault. This is just a simple program to freeze your game for x seconds. It has no malicious intent. You should be fine but use it at your own risk.
